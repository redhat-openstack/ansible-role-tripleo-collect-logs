Running TripleO Quickstart on Openstack instances
-------------------------------------------------

By default, TripleO Quickstart uses libvirt to create virtual machines (VM) to serve
as undercloud and overcloud nodes for a TripleO deployment.
With some steps and modification, TripleO Quickstart can setup an undercloud and
deploy the overcloud on instances launched on an Openstack cloud rather than libvirt VMs.

Beginning assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document details the workflow for running TripleO Quickstart on Openstack
instances. In particular, the example case is instances created via Heat and
Openstack Virtual Baremetal <https://github.com/cybertron/openstack-virtual-baremetal>.

The following are assumed to have been completed before following this document:

* An Openstack cloud exists and has been set up
  (and configured as described in
  <https://github.com/cybertron/openstack-virtual-baremetal#patching-the-host-cloud>
  if the cloud is pre-Mitaka release). From the Mitaka release the cloud should
  not require patching
* The undercloud image under test has been uploaded to Glance in the Openstack cloud.
* A heat stack has been deployed with instances for the undercloud, bmc, and overcloud nodes.
* The nodes.json file has been created (later to be copied to the undercloud as instackenv.json)

Below is an example `env.yaml` file used to create the heat stack that will support a
tripleo-quickstart undercloud and overcloud deployment with network isolation:
